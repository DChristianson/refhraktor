If you had a choice you never would have come to this planet.
Now the only way you can leave is if you can win The Fhrakas.

## The Fhrakas

It's a put the ball in the goal kind of game, except the high levels of radiation in the arena mean you don't
want to get anyhwere near the action. So instead you play from a gantry that spans the width of the field and use a laser
to direct a light reactive Sphere through an opposing Gate.

## The Sphere

The Sphere is made of an unknown material that reacts to light.

## Gates

The object of the game is to drive the Sphere through the opposing Gate while defending your own Gate. 
In some arenas you will need to defend more than one Gate, or defend a Gate thatspans the width of the field.
Some arenas even have Gates that can move or change size during the match. 

## Game Modes

Versus     - Two players face off in the arena
Quest      - Drive the target through a series of gates. The longer it takes to pass a gate
             the more the difficulty increases. 
Tournament - Each player selects the Gates and obstacles in their half of the arena.

## Mobile Targeting Pods

First things first you'll need a ride. You take a high powered laser, fit it to whatever chassis you can find then 
and get the whole thing to run on arena power track. If you want to make it easy on yourself just salvage an 
old AG-008 space-to-ground fighter, they have everything you need and thanks to the Galactic War there's no 
shortage of them here.

## Power

Your MTP rides on powered rails - only power around here is a little choppy. Mashing the trigger button will
drain your power reserves quickly, but timing your shots to each power surge will keep you in business.

## Weapons

You see anything and everything here but these are the most common.

Mark I pulse laser   - it's not the most powerful, but easy to install and much less prone to overheating. 
                       built in rectifiers to prevent power escape means you can fire continuously without penalty
                       tiny storage bank means you can't fire long
Mark IV laser cannon - the ultimate in high efficiency high yield energy weaponry
                       lack of power rectification mean you need to coordinate your shots with power surges
MX8 maser            - wide angle beam weapon reflects projectiles at close range
                       great for defensive counter play 

## Fhactions

Rekhwonwerk FhGmG
Syzygy Dawn
Cipher Space Conspiracy

## Auxiliary equipment             

If you're willing to work with the fhactions they might stake you an upgrade but you might not like the terms.

Grid Rectifier            - reduces power loss back into the grid by 50%
High Power Capacitor      - increases power bank size by 50%
Gravitic Wave Generator   - release powerful waves of energy to propel the target towards the opponent's goal
                            also disrupts laser fire due to the gravitational lens effect
EMP                       - massive ion blast capable of frying the opponent's grid
                            if you're not careful can explode your own grid

## Special Equipment

Just in case this place isn't dangerous enough for you... I've heard tales of some lunatic on the lower 
levels trading in exotic tech - gamma ray guns, meson lassos, quantomic bombs, something called a 
"tachyonic antitelephone"... risky business.
