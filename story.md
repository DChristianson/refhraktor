If you had a choice you never would have come to this planet.
Now the only way you can leave is if you can win the game known as The Fhrakas.

The Fhrakas

Mobile Turret

First things first you'll need to outfit a mobile turret. Take a high powered laser,
fit it to whatever chassis you can find then and get the whole thing to run on arena power rails.
If you want to make it easy on yourself just salvage an old AG-008 space-to-ground fighter, they 
have everything you need and thanks to the Galactic War there's no shortage of them here.


Weapons

Once you have your ride you'll need a weapon, you see anything and everything here but most likely you're
going to want to start with one


Mark I laser         - it's not the most powerful, but easy to install an much less prone to overheating. 
                       built in rectifiers to prevent power escape means you can fire continuously without penalty
                       tiny storage bank means you can't fire long
Mark IV laser        - the ultimate in high efficiency high yield 
                       you must coordinate your shots with power surges
Microwave emitter    - wide angle beam weapon deflects projectiles at close range
                       power hungry 
             
I've heard tales of some lunatic from the lower levels trading in exotics - gamma ray lasers, antimatter particles,
meson cannons, flux capacitors.

Special

If you're willing to work with the fhactions they might stake you some of their surplus equipment,
but you might not like the terms.

rectifier      - eliminates power loss back into the grid
HE capacitor   - increase in storage
Gravitic Wave  - releases a powerful wave of energy propelling the target towards the opponent's goal
EMP            - massive ion blast capable of frying the opponent's grid
                 if you're not careful can explode your own grid
