Play the game on [Javatari.org!](https://javatari.org/?ROM=https://github.com/DChristianson/refhraktor/releases/download/20220722/refhraktor_NTSC_20220722.bin)

WIP for a two player pinball-style game inspired by games like Ballistix (Amiga), Shufflepuck Cafe (various platforms).. and a little bit of Laser Blast

currently there's no score, or sound, or AI, or a menu...or different levels... just a POC demonstrating the shooting/collision mechanic, interested in any feedback
