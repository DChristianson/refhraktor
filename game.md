If you had a choice you never would have come to this planet.
Now your only chance to leave comes down to winning the game they call the Fhrakas.

## The Fhrakas

The object of Fhrakas is to drive a light reactive Fhrakasphere past the opponent's gate
while simultaneously defending your own gate.

"The Fhrakas is simple. Put the ball in the goal and you win. Only there's a catch - there are high 
levels of radiation in the arena - meaning you don't want to get anyhwere near the action. So instead 
you'll play from an elevated track and use a high powered laser to push the Spheres around."

## The Fhrakasphere

Fhrakaspheres are made of a light reactive material of unknown origin. 

## Gates

In a standard game you defend a single gate on one end of the field, but there are variants where
you will have to defend more than one Gate or even defend a Gate that spans the width of the field. 
Some arenas even have Gates that can move or change size during the match. 
 

## Game Modes

Versus     - Two players face off in the arena
Quest      - Drive the target through a series of gates. The longer it takes to pass a gate
             the more the difficulty increases. 
Tournament - Each player selects the Gates and obstacles in their half of the arena.

## Mobile Targeting Pods

"First things first you'll need a ride. You take a high powered laser, fit it to whatever chassis you can find then and get the whole thing to run on arena power track. If you want to make it easy on yourself just salvage an 
old AG-008 space-to-ground fighter, they have everything you need and thanks to the Galactic War there's no 
shortage of them here."

## Power Track

"Your MTP rides on powered rails - only power around here is a little choppy. Mashing the trigger button will
drain the rail quickly, but timing your shots to each power surge will keep you in business."

## Weapons

You see anything and everything here but these are the most common.

Mark I pulse laser   - it's not the most powerful, but easy to install and much less prone to overheating. 
                       built in rectifiers to prevent power escape means you can fire continuously without penalty
                       tiny storage bank means you can't fire long
Mark IV laser cannon - the ultimate in high efficiency high yield energy weaponry
                       lack of power rectification mean you need to coordinate your shots with power surges
MX 888 maser         - wide angle beam weapon completely reflects projectiles at close range
                       great for defensive counter play 

## Fhactions

If you're willing to work with the fhactions they might stake you an upgrade but you might not like the terms.

## Auxiliary equipment             

Grid Rectifier            - reduces power loss back into the grid by 50%
High Power Capacitor      - increases power bank size by 50%
Gravitic Wave Generator   - release powerful waves of energy to propel the target towards the opponent's goal
                            also disrupts laser fire due to the gravitational lens effect
EMP                       - massive ion blast capable of frying the opponent's grid
                            if you're not careful can explode your own grid

## Special Equipment

Just in case this place isn't dangerous enough for you... I've heard tales of some lunatic on the lower 
levels trading in exotic tech - gamma ray guns, meson lassos, quantomic bombs, something called a 
"tachyonic antitelephone"... risky business.
